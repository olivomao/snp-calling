- generated by snp_read_cov1
- format:
col-0: gPos (1-based==>0-based?)
col-1: # of m reads covering the snp
col-2: # of p reads covering the snp
col-3: (*) if no m/p reads covering the snps

#log of readBed generation at sel snps:
#example:
#65282191        ENST00000560564.1,99,93
#25299383        [['ENST00000384274.1', 26, 68, 94]]     (*)

col-0: snp (1-based==>0-based?)

col-1: trid,# bases left to snp (b1),# bases right to snp (b2) (s.t. either b1 or b2 < readLen-1 and b1+b2 is largest window size ever seen)

col-2 etc: same as col-1

in case the snp is covered by no read (probably the snp is in the transcript with len < readLen), 
this snp & related tr info (list of [trid, L_left, L_right, L_left+L_right]) is also in log, appended with (*)
